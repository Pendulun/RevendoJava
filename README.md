# RevendoJava
The objective of this repository is to register some of my tests/studies in Java.

## IDE
Eclipse IDE

## What I've done

- Collections 
  1. Compared searching objects in List's analysing the number of times the equals method was called. (package [java.src.collections.lists](https://github.com/Pendulun/RevendoJava/tree/main/Java/src/collections/lists)).
  2. Compared searching objects in List's with and without previous ordering analysing the number of comparations needed. (package [java.src.collections.lists.searchSortingFirst](https://github.com/Pendulun/RevendoJava/tree/main/Java/src/collections/lists/searchSortingFirst))
  3. Compared searching objects in HashMap's and List's analysing the number of times the equals method was called. (package [java.src.collections.hashmap.searchInArrayListAndHashMap](https://github.com/Pendulun/RevendoJava/tree/main/Java/src/collections/hashmap/searchInArrayListAndHashMap)). **Spoiler**: HashMap is much better
